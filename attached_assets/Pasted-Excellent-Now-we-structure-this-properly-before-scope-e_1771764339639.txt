* Social network
* Payment infrastructure
* Admin control system

We must control complexity.

Below is the **complete page architecture**, grouped by user type, with:

* Page Name

# ⚠️ Important Reality

You should NOT build all 55 in 12 weeks.

Phase 1 must launch with:

* 10–12 mobile screens
* 6 organizer pages
* 4 admin pages

Everything else feature-flagged.

---

Now critical question:

Do you want:

A) Strict MVP (12-week lean launch)
B) Aggressive Full Build (higher burn, bigger team)
C) Phased Modular Release (recommended for VC optics)

Choose carefully.
