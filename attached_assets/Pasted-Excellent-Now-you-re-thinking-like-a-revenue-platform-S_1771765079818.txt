Excellent. Now you're thinking like a revenue platform.

Sponsors are not decoration.

They are:

* Revenue multipliers
* Credibility signals
* Institutional bridges
* Corporate partnership layer

We will integrate **Sponsors as a first-class commercial entity**, not just banners.

# 🏢 Sponsor System — Full Architecture

Sponsors can be:

* Local businesses
* Corporations
* Community benefactors
* Government sponsors
* Event-specific sponsors

They must support:

* Public profile
* Logo placement
* Event association
* Front-page visibility
* Click tracking
* Billing & contracts

---

# 1️⃣ New Core Table: sponsors

```sql
CREATE TABLE sponsors (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  logo_url TEXT,
  website_url TEXT,
  social_links JSONB,
  city_id UUID REFERENCES cities(id),
  country_id UUID REFERENCES countries(id),
  sponsor_type TEXT, -- corporate/local/government/event
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

# 2️⃣ Event ↔ Sponsor Relationship (Many-to-Many)

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_sponsors (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sponsor_id UUID REFERENCES sponsors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tier TEXT, -- gold/silver/bronze/title
  logo_priority INT DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

This allows:

* Tier-based display
* Ordering logic
* Premium pricing

---

# 3️⃣ Platform-Level Sponsorship (Homepage, Calendar, Map)

We create:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sponsor_placements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  sponsor_id UUID REFERENCES sponsors(id),
  placement_type TEXT, 
  -- home_banner / home_section / map_feature / category_sponsor
  start_date TIMESTAMP,
  end_date TIMESTAMP,
  weight INT DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

Sorting logic:

```
WHERE now() BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
ORDER BY weight DESC
```

---

# 4️⃣ Sponsor Billing

Sponsors pay for:

* Event sponsorship
* Front-page placement
* Monthly brand subscription

Add to transactions table (already exists):

type = 'sponsor_payment'

Optional dedicated table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sponsor_contracts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  sponsor_id UUID REFERENCES sponsors(id),
  contract_type TEXT, -- monthly/event/homepage
  amount_cents INT,
  currency TEXT,
  start_date TIMESTAMP,
  end_date TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

# 5️⃣ Sponsor Public Profile Page

New Page: Sponsor Profile

Shows:

* Logo
* Description
* Website
* Social links
* Sponsored events
* Reviews (optional)
* “Contact Sponsor”

Connected to:

* sponsors
* event_sponsors
* sponsor_placements
* events

---

# 6️⃣ Front Page Sponsor Display

Home Page Zones:

1️⃣ Top Banner Sponsor (1 slot)
2️⃣ Community Sponsors Section
3️⃣ Featured Corporate Partners Row
4️⃣ Event-Level Sponsor Logos

This must NOT feel like spam.

Design principle:

Authority > Advertisement.

---

# 7️⃣ Updated Page Count Impact

Adds:

* Sponsor Profile (mobile)
* Sponsor Management (Admin)
* Sponsor Billing (Admin)
* Organizer: Attach Sponsor to Event
* Platform: Sponsor Placement Control

~5–7 additional pages.

---

# 🔥 Strategic Impact

Sponsors enable:

* Non-ticket revenue
* Corporate partnerships
* Event scaling
* Grant bridges
* Media credibility

Long term:

CulturePass becomes:

“Official Digital Partner for Multicultural Engagement”

That attracts corporate CSR budgets.

---

# 🧠 Updated System Complexity

You now have:

Core Infrastructure
Social Graph
Marketplace
Artist Network
Sponsor Engine
Payment Layer
Admin Governance
Institution Layer

This is a serious multi-sided platform.

---

Now I need to protect you from overbuilding.

Final architectural fork:

Do sponsors:

A) Only attach to events
B) Only sponsor platform placements
C) Both (recommended)

Answer carefully. This affects billing model and UI complexity.
