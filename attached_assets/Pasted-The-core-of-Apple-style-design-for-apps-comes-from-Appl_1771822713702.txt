The core of **Apple-style design** for apps comes from Apple's **Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)**, which emphasize creating intuitive, elegant, and user-focused experiences across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and other platforms.

Apple's design philosophy has historically revolved around a few foundational principles. While the exact wording and emphasis evolve (especially with major updates like the **Liquid Glass** material introduced around 2025), the timeless pillars remain:

### Core Apple HIG Principles
1. **Clarity**  
   Make interfaces legible, precise, and easy to understand. Use clear text (with excellent readability via system fonts like SF Pro), sharp graphics/icons, precise controls, and minimal visual noise. Users should grasp what to do instantly without confusion.

2. **Deference**  
   The UI should step back and let content shine. Minimize unnecessary decorations, chrome, or clutter so users focus on their tasks/content rather than the interface itself. Controls and navigation should feel secondary and discoverable with minimal effort.

3. **Depth**  
   Use visual hierarchy, subtle layers, realistic motion, shadows, translucency, and parallax-like effects to convey structure and relationships. This creates a sense of dimension and helps users understand navigation (e.g., cards sliding over backgrounds, smooth transitions).

These three have been the classic trio for years (often highlighted in iOS/macOS HIG sections), guiding everything from layout to animation.

### Additional Key Characteristics of "Apple-style" Apps (Especially in Recent Years)
- **Consistency** — Follow system patterns so users transfer knowledge from one app to another (e.g., standard navigation bars, tab bars, sheet presentations, swipe gestures).
- **Minimalism & Simplicity** — Fewer onscreen elements, generous whitespace, focus on primary content/tasks. Secondary actions are hidden but easily accessible (e.g., long-press, swipe-to-reveal).
- **Ergonomics & Reachability** — Place key controls in thumb-friendly zones (bottom/middle of screen on iPhone).
- **Motion & Feedback** — Fluid, meaningful animations that feel natural and provide delight without overwhelming.
- **Aesthetic Integrity** — The look matches the function; everything feels cohesive and premium.
- **Liquid Glass Influence** (2025+ era) — Translucent, reflective/refractive materials that dynamically adapt, bring harmony between hardware/software/content, rounded elements that align with device corners, more expressive yet familiar controls, and greater cohesion across platforms.

### Practical Tips to Apply Apple Style to Your App
- Use **SF Symbols** and **system fonts** (SF Pro, New York) — don't custom-design everything.
- Adopt **SwiftUI** patterns if building for Apple platforms — it naturally encourages deference and clarity.
- Prioritize content hierarchy: Big titles, ample padding, subtle separators.
- Support Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, and accessibility features from day one.
- Test on real devices for ergonomics and motion feel.
- Avoid heavy skeuomorphism or flat design extremes — aim for balanced, modern elegance with subtle depth/translucency.

If you describe your app (e.g., what it does, target platform like iOS or cross-platform, specific screens/features you're designing), I can give more tailored advice on applying these principles!
