Excellent. Now we’re designing something truly intelligent.

You’re describing a system that:

• Prioritises local relevance
• Elevates homeland significance
• Detects national-importance signals (e.g. Prime Minister visit)
• Respects language identity
• Remains computationally efficient

Let’s upgrade Tier 5 properly.

# 🧠 CultureOS Adaptive Cultural Ranking Engine v2

## Homeland + Significance-Aware Model

---

# 1️⃣ Refined Tier System (Efficient Candidate Pooling)

We keep strict candidate filtering before scoring.

### Tier 1 — City + Community Match

Exact city + at least one shared community.

### Tier 2 — City Radius

Within radius (PostGIS).

### Tier 3 — State Match

### Tier 4 — Community Match (Country-wide)

### Tier 5 — Homeland-Triggered Local Events (NEW LOGIC)

This is NOT “events in homeland country.”

It is:

> Events happening near the user that are culturally significant to their homeland.

Example:
User:

* Primary: Sydney
* Homeland: India

If:
• Onam in Sydney
• Diwali in NSW
• Indian Independence Day (August 15) in Parramatta
• Indian Prime Minister visits Sydney

These events should surge in ranking.

We do NOT scan India events.
We scan Sydney events tagged as:

```ts
homeland_tags: ['india']
national_significance: true
festival_type: 'independence_day'
```

Now you still only score 200–500 events.

Efficient.

---

# 2️⃣ New Data Fields Required

## 👤 users table additions

```ts
homeland_country_id
homeland_state_id (optional)

spoken_languages text[]

national_importance_boost_enabled boolean
```

Collected during onboarding.

Editable in Profile Settings.

---

## 🎟 events table additions

```ts
homeland_tags text[]         // e.g. ['india']
national_significance boolean
dignitary_level enum('none','state','prime_minister','president')
festival_key text             // e.g. 'onam','diwali','independence_day'
language_tags text[]
```

This makes the algorithm AI-readable and deterministic.

---

# 3️⃣ Language Matching Layer (NEW PRIORITY SIGNAL)

During sign-up:

Ask:

"What languages do you speak?"

Examples:
• Malayalam
• Hindi
• Tamil
• English

Store as:

```ts
spoken_languages[]
```

Language Score:

```ts
language_score =
  matched_languages / total_spoken_languages
```

This allows:

Malayalam-speaking user → Malayalam events in Sydney boosted.

No guesswork.

---

# 4️⃣ National Importance Detection (High-Impact Events)

If:

```ts
event.national_significance = true
```

OR

```ts
event.dignitary_level IN ('prime_minister','president')
```

Apply:

```ts
importance_multiplier = 1.3
```

If homeland match:

```ts
importance_multiplier = 1.6
```

Example:

If Indian Prime Minister visits Sydney:

* Narendra Modi
* Sydney

Users with homeland = India get massive relevance boost.

But still local.
Still efficient.
Still in the 200–500 pool.

---

# 5️⃣ Improved Final Scoring Model

Normalized features (0–1):

```ts
final_score =
  0.28 * geo_score +
  0.18 * community_score +
  0.12 * language_score +
  0.12 * homeland_local_score +
  0.10 * behaviour_score +
  0.10 * time_score +
  0.10 * popularity_score
```

Then:

```ts
if indigenous_flag && user.country == 'Australia'
  final_score *= 1.15

if national_significance
  final_score *= importance_multiplier
```

Homeland local score:

```ts
homeland_local_score =
  event.homeland_tags.includes(user.homeland_country)
    ? 1
    : 0
```

Clean.
Explainable.
AI-tunable.

# 6️⃣ Discover Page Updates (Critical UX Upgrade)

After login:

---

## 🏠 Happening Near You

Pure geo relevance.

---

## 🌐 Your Communities

Community-tag match.

---

## 🇮🇳 Homeland Moments (Dynamic Section)

If homeland_country_id exists:

Show:

• Festivals happening locally
• Cultural days
• National days
• Dignitary visits
• Major homeland-linked celebrations

Example:

“Indian Independence Events in NSW”
“Onam Celebrations Near You”

---

## 🗣 In Your Language

If spoken_languages exists:

Show:

“Malayalam Events in Sydney”
“Hindi Cultural Programs”

---

## 🖤 First Nations Spotlight (Australia Only)

Boost during:

* NAIDOC Week
* National Reconciliation Week

---

## 🎯 Recommended For You

Blended high-score results.

---

# 7️⃣ Onboarding Flow Update

## Step 1 — Primary Location

Country → State → City

## Step 2 — Homeland

“Which country do you feel connected to?”

Optional state selection.

## Step 3 — Cultural Communities (Multi-select)

## Step 4 — Languages Spoken (Multi-select)

## Step 5 — Radius Preference

---

# 8️⃣ Why This Algorithm Is Better

It now detects:

✔ Local cultural relevance
✔ Diaspora significance
✔ Language alignment
✔ National importance
✔ Political/diplomatic high-impact events
✔ Indigenous priority
✔ Time sensitivity

And still only ranks 200–500 candidates.

Efficient.
Scalable.
Human-intelligent.

---

# 9️⃣ Long-Term Upgrade Path (Optional)

Later:

• Use embedding similarity (OpenAI vectors)
• Detect event descriptions mentioning homeland keywords
• Auto-tag dignitary events via news integration
• Predict festival recurrence patterns

---

# 🔥 What You’ve Just Built

Not an event feed.

But:

> A Cultural Identity-Aware Relevance Engine.

This is what makes CulturePass by CultureOS fundamentally different.

If you want next:

* I can write the full SQL implementation
* Build the discover endpoint logic
* Design the onboarding UI screens
* Or optimise this for Stripe-sponsored high-priority events

What do we implement next?
