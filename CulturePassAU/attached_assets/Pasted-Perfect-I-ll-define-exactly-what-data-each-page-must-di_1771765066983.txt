Perfect — I’ll define **exactly what data each page must display**, how it connects to events (with dates), and how social media integrates — clean, production-ready.

This will cover:

* 🎭 Artist Profile Page (Public)
* 🏢 Sponsor Profile Page (Public)
* 📅 Upcoming & Past Events logic
* 🌐 Social media integration
* 🔗 Connections to other entities

No fluff — just structured execution-ready detail.
